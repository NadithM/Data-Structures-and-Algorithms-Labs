First set the places you want to goto by starting place
ex.
"
here we start from Colombo so
set the varible in Main call places
like
String places = "Colombo Anuradhapura Trincomalee Kandy Galle NuwaraEliya Jaffna Arugambay Pinnawala Yala\n";

"
Run the GraphApp1.java

NOte :

Penalty for using same path again and again added as below

if we use 3times one path that cost 100 ,in the full trip

as you metioned
first time cost 100
second time cost for that path is 200

then if it uses for third time I got it as

Trird time cost 300 for using that path
like that......
